# SYB GraphQL API - Final Contact Discovery Report

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive investigation of the SYB GraphQL API to find primary account owner/creator email addresses, I have identified the limitations and opportunities for building a notification system.

**Key Finding**: The SYB GraphQL API does NOT expose the primary account creator/owner email addresses for the majority of accounts. Only accounts that have explicitly added users through the `access.users` field provide contact information.

## Investigation Results

### API Structure Analysis

1. **Account Type Schema**: 24 fields available on Account type
   - ‚ùå No direct owner/creator email fields (email, ownerEmail, contactEmail, etc.)
   - ‚ùå No owner/creator object fields (owner, creator, primaryUser, etc.)
   - ‚úÖ `access` field contains users who can access the account
   - ‚úÖ `billing` field exists but contains no contact information

2. **Available Contact Fields**:
   - `access.users` - Active users with full contact info (name, email, role)
   - `access.pendingUsers` - Invited users (email only)

### Contact Coverage Analysis

Based on testing with multiple accounts:

- **Total accounts tested**: 50+
- **Accounts with contact information**: ~4-5 (8-10%)
- **Contact coverage**: **Very Low (~10%)**
- **Available contacts when present**: 1-7 per account

### Sample Contact Data Found

```json
{
  "account": "Anantara Desaru Coast Resort & Villas",
  "active_users": 3,
  "pending_users": 1,
  "contacts": [
    {
      "type": "active",
      "name": "Norbert Platzer",
      "email": "norbert@bmasiamusic.com",
      "role": "Music Curator"
    },
    {
      "type": "active", 
      "name": "Peter Wagner",
      "email": "pwagner@anantara.com",
      "role": null
    },
    {
      "type": "pending",
      "email": "pvisvalingam@anantara.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Why Contact Coverage is Low

The low contact coverage (10-20%) indicates that:

1. **Account creators are not automatically added** to the `access.users` field
2. **Most accounts were created** through a system/process that doesn't expose the creator
3. **Users must be explicitly invited/added** to appear in the API
4. **Primary account owners** may not have added themselves as users

This is actually common in B2B SaaS systems where:
- Accounts are created through sales/onboarding processes
- The billing/administrative contact is separate from API user management
- Primary owners delegate account management to other users

## Recommendations

### 1. Build Notification System for Available Contacts

**Immediate Action**: Implement notifications for the accounts that DO have contact information available.

**Working GraphQL Query**:
```graphql
{
  me {
    ... on PublicAPIClient {
      accounts(first: 100) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            businessName
            access {
              users(first: 20) {
                edges {
                  node {
                    id
                    name
                    email
                    companyRole
                  }
                }
              }
              pendingUsers(first: 20) {
                edges {
                  node {
                    email
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Contact SYB Support

**Request from SYB**:
1. Access to account creator/owner information
2. Documentation on how to access primary account contacts
3. Clarification on whether this data exists in their system
4. Alternative API endpoints for account ownership

### 3. Encourage User Addition

**Process Improvement**:
1. Request that account owners add themselves as users
2. Include user addition in onboarding processes
3. Periodically audit accounts for missing contacts

### 4. Alternative Contact Methods

**Backup Strategies**:
1. Store contact information in your local database
2. Use business names to lookup contacts externally
3. Implement manual contact management system
4. Use alternative notification channels (SMS, phone, etc.)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate (Available Contacts)
- ‚úÖ Implement notification system using `access.users` field
- ‚úÖ Build dashboard interface for selecting accounts to notify
- ‚úÖ Create email templates for zone status alerts
- ‚úÖ Test with the ~10% of accounts that have contacts

### Phase 2: Contact Discovery (1-2 weeks)
- üìß Contact SYB support about accessing account creator information
- üìã Document accounts without contacts for follow-up
- üîÑ Implement process to encourage user addition

### Phase 3: Expansion (1+ months)
- üîß Based on SYB support response, expand contact discovery
- üìä Track notification delivery rates and effectiveness
- üöÄ Scale notification system to more accounts

## Notification System Architecture

### Contact Retrieval Function
```python
async def get_account_contacts():
    """Fetch accounts with their contact information."""
    # Use the working GraphQL query
    # Return structured data with account ID, name, and contacts
    # Filter out accounts without contacts
```

### Notification Selection UI
- List of accounts with contact counts
- Checkboxes for account selection
- Individual contact selection within accounts
- Bulk operations (all accounts, accounts with issues, etc.)

### Email Templates
- **Critical Alerts**: All zones offline
- **Warning Notifications**: Multiple zones offline  
- **Status Summaries**: Daily/weekly reports
- **Custom Messages**: Manual notifications

## Conclusion

While the SYB GraphQL API doesn't expose primary account owners for most accounts (as expected in many B2B systems), there is sufficient contact information available to build a functional notification system for the accounts that do have configured users.

**Recommended Approach**:
1. ‚úÖ Start with the ~10% of accounts that have contacts (~50-100 email addresses)
2. üìß Reach out to SYB for expanded access to account ownership data
3. üîÑ Implement processes to increase contact coverage over time
4. üìä Monitor and iterate based on notification effectiveness

This approach allows you to begin providing value immediately while working toward more comprehensive coverage.
