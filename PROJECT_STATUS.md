# SYB Zone Monitor - Project Status
Last Updated: June 17, 2025

## Current Deployment
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/brightears/syb-zone-monitor.git
- **Render Deployment**: Live and running with Python runtime
- **Monitoring**: 855 accounts with 2,536 zones total

## Recent Changes (June 17, 2025)

### 1. Complete Zone Discovery
- Successfully generated `accounts_discovery_results.json` with all 855 accounts and 2,536 zones
- File uploaded to Render as environment variable
- All zones now being monitored in real-time

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Implemented parallel zone checking (50 zones concurrently)
- Reduced timeout from 30s to 10s per zone
- Reduced retry attempts from 5 to 2
- Added progress logging
- **Result**: Zone checking time reduced from 10+ minutes to under 2 minutes

### 3. UI/UX Improvements
- **Offline Duration Tracking**: Shows how long zones have been offline (e.g., "2 hours", "3 days")
- **Modern Design**: Clean, minimal aesthetic with better typography and spacing
- **Aligned Zone Cards**: Fixed layout so all status badges align horizontally
- **Better Status Display**: Clear indicators for Connected, Offline, No Paired Device, Subscription Expired
- **Unknown Status**: Shows "â‹¯ Checking..." instead of "? unknown" for zones being initialized

### 4. Modal Improvements
- Fixed readability issues with light backgrounds and dark text
- Improved contact display with better contrast
- Added email icon instead of emoji for Notify button

### 5. Email Notification System
- Message composer with pre-written templates
- Filters to exclude @bmasiamusic.com emails by default
- Ready for SMTP configuration (waiting for support@bmasiamusic.com credentials)

## Known Issues
1. **Ascott Europe Zones**: Sometimes show as "unknown" - likely due to API access issues or initial loading time
2. **SMTP Not Configured**: Email sending saves to file instead of sending (pending credentials)

## Zone Status Types
1. **Connected** (green) - Zone is online and working
2. **Offline** (red) - Zone is paired but offline
3. **No Paired Device** (orange) - Zone has no device connected
4. **Subscription Expired** (gray) - Zone's subscription is not active
5. **Checking...** (light gray) - Zone status being checked

## Attempted Features (Reverted)
- **App Update Required Status**: Attempted to detect when zones need app updates using `status.canPlay` field, but this field doesn't exist in the API and broke all zone checking. Feature was reverted.

## Next Steps
1. Configure SMTP settings once support@bmasiamusic.com login details are received
2. Consider adding persistent storage for offline duration tracking
3. Investigate why some zones (like Ascott Europe) take longer to check
4. Add historical tracking and analytics

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with modern CSS
- **API**: SYB GraphQL API
- **Deployment**: Render (Python runtime)
- **Monitoring**: Real-time with 30-second refresh

## Environment Variables on Render
